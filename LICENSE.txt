SWITCHBOARD SDK MASTER LICENSE AGREEMENT

Effective Date: May 27, 2023

INTRODUCTION

Synervoz Communications Inc. develops and markets the Switchboard SDK. A list 
of its features is available at: https://docs.switchboard.audio/ 

To make use of the Switchboard SDK, the following license types are available:

1. Free Prototyping License to the Switchboard SDK, the "Prototyping License"
2. Commercial Licenses to the Switchboard SDK, "Commercial Licenses"
3. Example Code License, "Example Code License".

BACKGROUND

The Prototyping License is meant to be used to build and test new 
applications, or to test new feature ideas for existing applications 
(collectively, "New Projects"). Commercial Licenses are required when New 
Projects no longer meet the limitations set out in the Free Prototyping 
License. 

No support or guarantees are included with the Prototyping License. Support, 
customization, and other requests are offered as part of Synervoz's consulting 
services business, as well as through our Commercial Licenses. 

Commercial Licenses are required when one or more limitations of the Free 
Prototyping License is exceeded. Commercial Licenses are customized according 
to the customer's use case and requirements and require you to get in touch. 
The Prototyping License limitations are designed to allow for experimentation, 
evaluation, and to help with decision making. The limitations are not designed 
to allow for use of the Switchboard SDK in commercial products at scale. 

Synervoz makes available certain example code and sample apps to illustrate 
how the Switchboard SDK can be used in different types of projects. Unless 
otherwise noted, open source license files are provided with these example 
projects. These are distinct from licenses to the Switchboard SDK, which are 
governed by this Master License Agreement. If you use any example code or 
sample apps provided by Synervoz, you need to read these license files as 
well. 

Furthermore, the Switchboard SDK contains extensions to third party SDKs and 
services that have their own licensing requirements. Synervoz makes no 
representation as to the licensing requirements for any third party 
extensions. It is your responsibility to review these requirements yourself. 

Developers are free to experiment with the Switchboard SDK and to understand 
its capabilities and limitations prior to reaching out to Synervoz to discuss 
a Commercial License. When you've determined that the Switchboard SDK could be 
a good fit for your project and you are ready to discuss a Commercial License, 
please contact: 

licensing@synervoz.com 

Unauthorized and/or unlicensed usage of the Switchboard SDK or any other 
Synervoz technologies may result in interruption of service without notice. 
Synervoz is not required to provide notice of service interruption.  


LICENSE DETAILS AND DESCRIPTIONS

Prototyping License:

The Prototyping License is a free license to use the Switchboard SDK for 
experimentation and R&D purposes. It allows for public release and testing, 
including on the iOS App Store or Google Play Store, however, it is limited as 
follows: 

Limited to a maximum of 1,000 app-installs as determined by Synervoz's 
analytics. 
Synervoz reserves attribution rights including the right to use App 
Developer's name and logo on its website.
The Prototyping license is not to be used for products or installations in 
public venues such as a bar, theater, or conference hall. 

Once an app breaches the 1,000 app-install mark, or if your product will be 
installed for use in a public venue, a Commercial License is required. 
Synervoz reserves the right to disable usage and the Switchboard SDK may 
trigger this automatically.

Commercial Licenses
Commercial Licenses currently require licensing fees to be negotiated with 
Synervoz. You must get in touch with Synervoz via licensing@synervoz.com if 
the limitations of the Prototyping License no longer apply. 

Example Code License
Synervoz makes available certain example code and sample apps to illustrate 
how the Switchboard SDK can be used in different types of projects. Unless 
otherwise noted, license files are provided with these example projects. These 
are distinct from licenses to the Switchboard SDK, which are governed by this 
Master License Agreement. If you use any example code or sample apps provided 
by Synervoz, you need to read these license files as well. 

If you are using one of our example apps that contains the Switchboard SDK, 
you are also bound to this SWITCHBOARD SDK MASTER LICENSE AGREEMENT. 

WHAT IF I HAVE MORE THAN ONE APPLICATION?

You must have a license for each Application (as defined below), regardless of 
how you subdivide or commercialize your technology. Each distributed 
application must have its own license.

3.1 Compensation.

(a) Available Licenses; Marketing and Fees; Press Release.

(i) Prototyping License Requirements: There is no fee for the use of the 
Switchboard SDK, if and only if, Licensee's use of the Switchboard SDK is in a 
Software Application that has fewer than 1,000 app-installs.

For the purpose of determining the amount of installs of any Application, the 
aggregate number of installs across target operating systems/platforms shall 
be used.

For example, if "Your App" has 1,000 app installs on iOS and 2,000 app 
installs on Android, then Your App shall have 3,000 app installs for purposes 
of this Agreement.

Synervoz may cancel or modify the Prototyping License for the Switchboard SDK 
set forth in 
this section at any time with or without notice.

However, the Switchboard SDK is not open-source and the Licensee is still 
subject to all of the 
terms as set forth on the  first  page  of  this  Agreement.  Furthermore, 
Synervoz may make qualification determinations of the Prototyping License 
requirements in its sole discretion.

(ii) Commercial Licenses: If Licensee is using the Switchboard SDK in an 
application or combination of applications with more than 1,000 app-installs 
(including all versions of the Software Application) or otherwise does not 
qualify for the Prototyping License pursuant to Section 3.1(a)(i) above, prior 
to use of the Switchboard SDK the Licensee must purchase a Commercial License 
from Synervoz by contacting: 

licensing@synervoz.com  

A Commercial License needs to be agreed and paid prior to being valid. 

Licensee acknowledges that distribution of an Application or other technology 
using 
the Switchboard SDK with more than 1,000 app installs without a fully paid up 
Commercial License renders any licenses  granted  by Synervoz  hereunder  void 
 and  invalid.  Licensee acknowledges it has no expectation of uninterrupted 
ongoing service and access to Synervoz technology (including without 
limitation the Switchboard SDK) if such licenses granted by Synervoz hereunder 
are void and invalid, with or without notice, due to Licensee's failure to 
comply with the terms of this Agreement.

(iii) Example Code License: Synervoz makes available certain example code and 
sample apps to illustrate how the Switchboard SDK can be used in different 
types of projects. Unless otherwise noted, license files are provided with 
these example projects. These are distinct from licenses to the Switchboard 
SDK, which are governed by this Master License Agreement. If you use any 
example code or sample apps provided by Synervoz, you need to read these 
license files as well. 

If you are using one of our example apps that contains the Switchboard SDK, 
you are also bound to this SWITCHBOARD SDK MASTER LICENSE AGREEMENT. 

(b) Attribution. Licensee will comply with Section 5.2 to the exclusive 
approval of Synervoz. 
Synervoz may use Licensee's and/or its Application's name and logo for 
external marketing, such as on its website and press releases.

4.1 Intellectual Property.

(a) This Agreement does not transfer or assign to Licensee, any intellectual 
property right 
including any patent, design, industrial design, trademark, service mark, 
copyright or rights in 
any confidential information or trade secrets, in or related to the 
Switchboard SDK or any part thereof. The Switchboard SDK and all copies 
thereof remain the property of Synervoz and are only licensed under this 
Agreement. Licensee acknowledges that there are no implied licenses granted 
under this Agreement, and all rights, save for those license rights expressly 
granted to Licensee hereunder, shall remain with Synervoz. Licensee agrees 
that nothing in this Agreement shall adversely affect any rights and recourse 
to remedies, including  without  limitation, injunctive  relief  that Synervoz 
may have under any applicable laws relating to the protection of Synevoz's 
intellectual property or other rights.

(b) Any feedback or suggestions provided to Synervoz by Licensee relating to 
the Switchboard SDK, shall be owned by Synervoz and Licensee hereby assigns to 
Synervoz all such feedback 
and suggestions.

5.1 Confidentiality. Other than as incorporated in the Applications' 
documentation, Licensee shall not sell, transfer, publish, disclose, display 
or otherwise make available the Switchboard SDK or copies thereof to others. 
Licensee shall use reasonable efforts to secure and protect the 
Switchboard SDK, documentation and copies thereof and to take appropriate 
action by instruction or agreement with its Authorized Users.

5.2 Synervoz Attribution for Use of Switchboard SDK with Prototyping License. 
To maintain continued service of the Switchboard SDK under a Prototyping

Licensee's applications, whether or not such damages could reasonably be 
foreseen or their likelihood has been disclosed to Synervoz. In no event shall 
any officer, director, employee, agent, supplier, independent contractor, or 
any merchants of record of Synervoz or any Synervoz affiliate have any 
liability arising from or related to this agreement. 

6.3 Limitation of Liability. In no event shall Synervoz be liable for any 
damages that exceed, 
in the aggregate for all claims arising from or related to this Agreement, the 
sum of any amounts 
Licensee has paid Synervoz for the Switchboard SDK from which such claim arose.

6.4 Exceptions. Some jurisdictions do not allow limitations or exclusions of 
certain types of 
damages and/or warranties and conditions. The limitations, exclusions and 
disclaimers set forth in this Agreement shall not apply if and only if and to
